// Best Practices for Writing Good Code

// Commenting and Documentation:
// - Use meaningful comments to explain complex logic.
// - Provide clear documentation for functions and classes.

// Consistent Indentation:
// - Use consistent indentation (e.g., 2 or 4 spaces) to improve code readability.

// Avoiding Obvious Comments:
// - Avoid comments that merely restate the code. Make comments informative.

// Grouping Code:
// - Group related code together to enhance readability and maintainability.

// Consistent Naming Scheme:
// - Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., camelCase, PascalCase) for variables and functions.

// Keeping it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
// - Avoid duplicating code; use functions or classes to encapsulate reusable logic.

// Avoid Deep Nesting:
// - Limit the depth of nested code blocks to improve code clarity.

// Limit Line Length:
// - Keep lines of code reasonably short (typically 80-120 characters) for easy reading.

// File and Directory Organization:
// - Organize code files and directories logically to facilitate navigation.

// Consistent Temporary Names:
// - Use consistent names for temporary variables (e.g., temp, i, j) to improve readability.

// Capitalize SQL Special Words:
// - Capitalize SQL keywords (e.g., SELECT, FROM, WHERE) for clarity.

// Separation of Code and Data:
// - Separate code and data; avoid hardcoding data within code.

// Alternate Syntax Inside Templates:
// - Use template literals or string interpolation for complex string formatting within templates.

// Appropriately Using Object-Oriented or Procedural:
// - Choose the appropriate programming paradigm (OOP or procedural) based on project needs.

// Read Lots of Open Source Code:
// - Study open-source projects to learn from others and improve your coding skills.

// Use Meaningful Names for Variables and Functions:
// - Choose descriptive names that convey the purpose of variables and functions.

// Avoid Magic Numbers:
// - Replace magic numbers with named constants or variables to enhance code maintainability.

// Refactor:
// - Periodically refactor code to improve its structure, readability, and efficiency.
