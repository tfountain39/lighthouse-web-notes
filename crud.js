/**
 * CRUD Overview:
 * 
 * CRUD stands for the primary actions performed on data in web applications:
 * 1. Create: Add new data.
 * 2. Read: Retrieve existing data.
 * 3. Update: Modify existing data.
 * 4. Delete: Remove data.
 *
 * Example using a JavaScript object 'users':
 * - Create: users["5315"] = {first_name: "John", last_name: "Smith"}
 * - Read: users["5315"]
 * - Update: users["5315"].first_name = "Jane"
 * - Delete: delete users["5315"]
 *
 * However, in real-world applications, databases are used for data persistence.
 * 
 * HTTP & CRUD:
 * Web apps typically communicate with databases over HTTP. The HTTP methods correspond to CRUD actions as:
 * - GET: Read
 * - POST: Create (and sometimes Update)
 * - PUT: Update
 * - DELETE: Delete
 *
 * It's suggested to use HTTP methods per their guidelines:
 * - GET should be 'safe' without side effects on the server.
 * - Actions like data update should be idempotent.
 * 
 * Browser Limitations:
 * Due to browser restrictions, only GET and POST are commonly used with web interactions.
 * - GET is used for reading.
 * - POST is often used as a substitute for both creating and updating (and even deleting) data.
